38,plosive,1,"This refers to a complete closure in the mouth with the soft palate raised, building pressure and releasing it in a burst, as in the first sound of pie, tie, or kye. This is another term for stop sound."
39,Nasal,1,"This refers to a closure in the mouth while air flows through the nose because the soft palate is lowered, as in the first sound of my or nigh or the last sound of sang."
40,Fricative,1,"This refers to a narrow passage that creates a steady hiss like noise, as in the first sound of sigh or the first sound of shoe."
41,Sibilant,1,"This refers to a higher pitched subset of fricatives with a strong hiss, such as the sounds in sigh and shoe."
42,Approximant,1,"This refers to a close approach of articulators without enough narrowing to make turbulence, as in the first sound of we or yacht."
43,Laterality,1,"This property refers to a consonant manner where the center of the tongue makes contact so that central airflow is blocked and air escapes along one or both sides; in English, a clear example is the sound represented by the letter L in the word lie."

56,Spectrum,1,This refers to the display that shows which frequencies are present and how strong they are in a short time slice of the sound.
57,Spectrogram,1,"This refers to a display that stacks many short time spectra to show time across, frequency up and down, and loudness by shade; it mirrors how the ear analyzes sound and reveals articulatory signatures."
59,Frequency,1,This refers to how many cycles occur in one second in a repeating pattern; it is the measurable counterpart of pitch.
60,Amplitude,1,This refers to how large the pressure variations are; darker shading on a spectrogram indicates higher amplitude.
61,Periodicity,1,"This refers to the presence of a regular repeating pattern in a waveform, which is often seen in vowels."
62,Formant,1,This refers to a strong resonance band of a vowel that comes from the shape of the vocal tract; the second band is historically linked to a classic glass filling demonstration.
63,First formant,2,"This refers to the lower resonance band of a vowel that moves opposite to tongue height, being lower for high tongue vowels and higher for low tongue vowels; it can be noticed in certain voice qualities."
64,Second formant,2,This refers to the higher resonance band of a vowel that roughly tracks whether the tongue is more toward the front or the back; a classic demonstration describes how it changes as a glass fills.
65,Vowel backneess,2,"This refers to whether the highest part of the tongue is toward the front, as in the vowel of heed, or toward the back, as in the vowels of father, good, and food."

67,Lip rounding,2,"This refers to whether the lips are rounded, which is common in many back vowels like those in good and food, versus unrounded as in heed."
68,Vowel targets,2,"This refers to the idea that vowels can be described by targets for tongue height, front back position, and lip rounding; the path between targets is continuous in real speech."
69,Suprasegmentals,1,"This refers to features layered over sounds and syllables, especially stress and pitch, and also differences in length."
70,Stress,1,"This refers to the relative prominence of a syllable, created by greater loudness, clearer segment features such as vowel height and aspiration, and wider pitch movement; in English it can distinguish a noun from a verb in pairs such as an insult and to insult."

71,Intonation,1,This refers to changes in voice pitch linked to the rate of vibration of the vocal folds; these changes can occur independently of stress and can change a statement into a question.
